# Bytehub+ Website

This repository contains the source for the Bytehub+ community website. The Bytehub+ core project is: [https://github.com/bytehubplus](https://github.com/bytehubplus)

# Contributing
The website is based on hugo and is hosted by github.io, AKA Github Pages. Github Pages builds the website from /docs, thus hugo build output must be docs instead of public, so specify `-d` when building.

```
hugo -d docs
```
